If you are coming from version 2.0.0 or 2.0.1 and need to upgrade to version 2.0.2 please follow along.

For the most part the installation and setup will be automated and not require any extra steps from you. The new wallet uses the same blockchain data folder as v2.0.0 and 2.0.1.

## Widows

Windows specific instructions. 

The first step is to make sure you have closed the old version of the Qt wallet. After this you can run the MSI installer package. Simply double click on the installer and approve the install.
