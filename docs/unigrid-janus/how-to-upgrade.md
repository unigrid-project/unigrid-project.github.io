## How to upgrade your wallet

If you are coming from version 2.0.0 or 2.0.1 and need to upgrade to version 2.0.2 please follow along.

For the most part the installation and setup will be automated and not require any extra steps from you. The new wallet uses the same blockchain data folder as v2.0.0 and 2.0.1.
