## Sending tokens

The first step is to send tokens to your address. For a gridnode to operate, ensure that one [input](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-inputs-and-outputs) in your address holds precisely 2,000 tokens (note: older gridnodes with 3,000 tokens will still function).

To begin, copy your main address (the one tokens were minted to as currently you are only allowed to send tokens to that same address). Click on the clipboard icon adjacent to the address you intend to send tokens to.

Next, send exactly 2,000 tokens to this address. From the main `Wallet` screen, select `Send`. Input the address you've just copied and specify 2,000 tokens. Click `Send` and provide your passphrase if your wallet is encrypted.

## Get transaction hash

Once the transaction processes, it will display on your `Wallet` screen. Allow a few minutes for the transaction to register on the network. Navigate to the `Nodes` screen and press the `Setup` button.

![](../../assets/images/gh-setup-view.png)

On the `Setup` screen, if your transaction has been confirmed by the network, you'll see it. A green check indicates the transaction hasn't been used for another node, while a red ban icon signifies it's already in use.

On this screen, you'll also need to generate a key for the gridnode. Click the `Generate Key` button. This action copies the key to your clipboard for easy access. Alternatively, click on the clipboard icon when needed.

## Ensuring Correct Token Transactions for Gridnodes

<div style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red; margin: 10px 0;">
    <strong>Important:</strong> It's crucial to understand the importance of sending tokens to an input in a blockchain for the correct operation of gridnodes. Missteps in this process can lead to operational issues.
</div>



### Common Mistake: Multiple Transactions

A common mistake made is sending the same amount of tokens repeatedly, which causes the 2000 tokens to change inputs. When this happens, the previously used input becomes invalid, disrupting the functioning of your gridnode.

### Recommended Solution: Locking the Input

To avoid this issue, follow these steps each time you make a transaction:

1. Send the transaction with the tokens to the blockchain.
2. Retrieve the input generated by this transaction.
3. Temporarily store this input in your `gridnode.conf` file.
4. Restart Janus to lock in this input.
5. Now, this input is locked, and you can safely send another transaction following the same procedure.

By following this method, you ensure that each input is locked in before proceeding with another transaction, maintaining the continuity and functionality of your gridnodes.

### Example Transaction for `gridnode.conf`

Below is an example transaction in the `gridnode.conf` file:

If `2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0` is your transaction and output, note the following:

- The `gridnodeprivkey` value can be reused multiple times; for instance, you can use `93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg`.
  
- The alias, IP, and port can be arbitrary at this stage since the purpose is to lock the input before obtaining the accurate details from the setup script on the server.

For example, you might use `gridnode_1 127.0.0.2:51992` for one node. If you have another node, you could use `gridnode_2 127.0.0.2:51992`.


```plaintext
# Format: alias IP:port gridnodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
gridnode_1 127.0.0.2:51992 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0
```

If we had multiple transactions it could be like this.

```plaintext
# Format: alias IP:port gridnodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
gridnode_1 127.0.0.2:51992 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0
gridnode_2 127.0.0.2:51992 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 1
gridnode_3 127.0.0.2:51992 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 2
gridnode_4 127.0.0.2:51992 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 3
```

After restarting Janus now transaction `2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c` at `0` input will be locked and unspendable until you remove it from the `gridnode.conf` file.

<div style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red; margin: 10px 0;">
    <strong>Reminder:</strong> These are only temporary values you add to lock these transactions to stop the daemon from resending from the same input. To finish the setup process, follow along the rest of the guide to properly finish the node setup.

## Server setup

To follow this guide, you'll need a server running Ubuntu 18+, a Debian-based distro, or access to a VPS (Virtual Private Server). Several VPS servers are available for rent. We recommend a few that we've used for years:

[Contabo](https://contabo.com/){: .btn .btn-blue }
[OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/){: .btn .btn-blue }

We suggest a minimum of 4GB (these amounts can and will fluctuate) per gridnode you plan to run ***(resource requirements may change in future updates)***. In the future, gridnodes will benefit from dedicated servers, maximizing server resources and earning corresponding rewards.


## Connect to server

## Connect to server

### Windows

For Windows, use `powershell` or the Windows 11 `terminal`. We also recommend the `bitvise SSH client`, available for download [here](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client). `Bitvise` includes a file explorer, useful for transferring files to the server.

For connection, use the command below in `powershell` or `terminal`. Replace `root` with your VPS's assigned user and `127.0.0.1` with the server's IP address. After connecting, you'll be prompted for a password:

```bash
ssh root@127.0.0.1
```

For Bitvise users, follow this [guide](https://www.bitvise.com/getting-started-connect-first-time) to connect to your VPS.

### OSX and Linux

On OSX and Linux, use the terminal to connect to the server. The example below demonstrates the connection process. Replace `root` with your VPS's assigned user and `127.0.0.1` with the server's IP address. After connecting, you'll be prompted for a password:

```bash
ssh root@127.0.0.1
```

## gridnode script

We've developed an automated script for gridnode installation and setup. This script fetches the latest wallet for your server and uses the previously copied transaction ID to initiate a gridnode. Click the icon below to copy the script:

![](../../assets/images/gn-copy-script.png)

Alternatively, copy (ctrl+v or cmd+v) the code below and paste it into your terminal. In the `bitvise SSH client`, right-click to paste:

```bash
bash -ic "$(wget -4qO- -o- raw.githubusercontent.com/unigrid-project/unigrid-installer/main/node_installer.sh)" ; source ~/.bashrc
```

After installation, the script will prompt for a txid and output index, which corresponds to the earlier copied transaction ID. Enter this ID and press `ENTER`.

![](../../assets/images/gn-paste-txid.png)

Following this, the script will request the key generated earlier. Input this key and press `ENTER`. The script will then retrieve the latest docker image for `Unigrid`.

![](../../assets/images/gn-image-download.png)

After setup and a full sync of the blockchain (5-10 minutes), you should now see something like the below with a string at the end starting with `ugd_docker`. This is the string we will need to copy back in our conf file to enable the gridnode.

![](../../assets/images/gn-script-end.png)image.png
The outputs from the script are also placed in a txt file on your server. To open that type `nano ~/gridnodes.txt`. If nano is not installed you can also try `vim ~/gridnodes.txt`.
## Configuration file

Return to the `Unigrid Janus` wallet, navigate to the nodes/setup screen, and click the `Open Config` button. This action opens a text file where you should paste the script's output.

![](../../assets/images/gn-open-config.png)

Ensure each node entry is on a separate line for the wallet to parse the file correctly. Avoid adding text other than the script's output, as it might prevent the wallet from opening. ***After saving and closing this file, it's essential to restart your wallet, especially if you're setting up multiple gridnodes simultaneously. While this step will not be necessary in future releases, it's currently the only method to configure multiple gridnodes.***

![](../../assets/images/gn-config.png)

## Starting the node

After restarting your wallet, the configuration file will load, allowing you to initiate the node. Ensure your wallet is synchronized before starting any `MISSING` nodes. 

To start, navigate to the `Nodes` screen and press the `Start` button. This action will attempt to activate any disabled nodes in the list. If your wallet is encrypted, you'll be prompted for your password. Occasionally, this step may need to be repeated several times before the network recognizes your newly generated gridnodes. This is a known bug, but it will be resolved once we transition to the Cosmos SDK chain.

## Install another node

If you wish to install an additional node on the same server and have the necessary resources, follow the steps above and execute the installer script again. Happy noding!

## Built in script commands

The installer includes utility commands for accessing nodes and retrieving information. Here's a brief list:

```bash
unigrid list
````

Shows a list of all running containers that are installed.

```bash
unigrid status
```

Shows whether the containers are running and for how long.

```bash
unigrid debug
```

Returns information about the gridnode start start for all containers.

```bash
unigrid restart-all
```

Restart all containers.

```bash
unigrid start-all
```

Start all containers.

```bash
unigrid get-blocks
```

Returns the block height of each node container.

```bash
unigrid resync-node ugd_docker_1
```

Resyncs a single gridnode using the bootstrap file. This does not remove any of your nodes settings and only installs a freshly synced chain. Use this is you are having trouble syncing a node. If you have more than one node you can change the name of <ugd_docker_1> to the gridnode you would like to resync.

```bash
unigrid remove-all
```

Removes all containers you have installed. **Warning this cannot be undone. Only use for full reintalls of all contianers.**

```bash
unigrid help
```

List of available commands for `unigrid`.

## Single node communication

To communicate with an individual node, use its container name followed by the desired command. For instance, the first installed container will be named `ugd_docker_1`.

```bash
ugd_docker_1 getinfo
```

To restart a single container.

```bash
docker restart ugd_docker_1
```

To enter the container itself.

```bash
docker exec -it ugd_docker_1 /bin/bash
```

Get the block count of a single container.

```bash
ugd_docker_1 getblockcount
```
