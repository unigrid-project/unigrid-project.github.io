## Proposal

A governance proposal to conduct a token sale on the [NFPAD](https://nfpad.io/) launchpad, allocate the raised funds to UGD Software AB for software development, and reserve a portion of the tokens for community needs IE listing fees.

### Context

With the evolution of the Unigrid project, there's a pressing need to secure funds for the continuation and expansion of software development. This proposal suggests leveraging the [NFPAD](https://nfpad.io/) launchpad for a token sale. The majority of the funds raised will be directed to UGD Software AB, ensuring that the project's milestones and objectives are achieved in a timely manner. 

Furthermore, a designated portion of the tokens from this sale will be set aside to address community needs. This includes covering any listing fees and other community-driven initiatives, ensuring a balanced and holistic growth approach for the entire ecosystem.
