## Status 

DRAFT

> Use DRAFT if the Governance Proposal is in a draft stage or PROPOSED if it's in review. You can read more about governance proposal stages [here](../best-practices.md).

## Proposal

> This proposal aims to revise the tokenomics of our blockchain by reducing the total token supply from 150,000,000 to 100,000,000 and adjusting the vesting schedule. Additionally, it proposes to decrease the quorum required for votes to pass from 50% to 30%.

## Context

The current token supply and vesting schedule were established under different market conditions. Since then, our ecosystem has evolved, necessitating a more agile and adaptive tokenomic structure. Reducing the total supply aims to enhance the project's appeal to investors and market participants, potentially increasing token value and decreasing the project's Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV). A streamlined vesting schedule aligns more closely with our accelerated development and market engagement timelines. The reduction in quorum threshold for votes is proposed in response to the challenges faced in reaching the current 50% requirement, which poses a risk of stagnation and inability to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions.

The blockchain ecosystem is dynamically evolving, and our DAO governance model needs to adapt accordingly. The current high quorum requirements have become a significant barrier to effective decision-making, especially as the number of nodes and potential voters increases. This can lead to stagnation in governance, as achieving a 50% quorum becomes increasingly challenging. The proposed reduction in quorum to 30% for minor changes and 40% for major changes is designed to enhance governance agility and responsiveness, ensuring that vital decisions can be made efficiently without being hindered by participation challenges.

| **Total**         | **100%**   | **100,000,000** |

## Proposed Vesting Schedule

| Category          | % on TGE | Ramp-Up | Vesting |
|-------------------|----------|---------|---------|
| Angel             | 5%       | 7       | 12      |
| Seed/Private      | 10%      | 6       | 8       |
| Public (IDO)      | 20%      | 0       | 6       |
| Node Runners      | 5%       | 7       | 12      |
| Foundation        | 0%       | 6       | 36      |
| Ecosystem Fund    | 2%       | 6       | 24      |
| Liquidity         | 13%      | 0       | 16      |
| Community Rewards | 0%       | 6       | 24      |
| Team              | 0%       | 12      | 24      |
| Marketing         | 0%       | 5       | 24      |

## Revised Quorum Requirements

In light of the increasing number of nodes and the observed challenges in achieving quorum, the proposal includes revising the quorum requirements as follows:

- For minor changes: Quorum requirement reduced from 50% to 30%.
- For major changes: Quorum requirement reduced from 66% to 40%.

These adjustments aim to foster more active and efficient governance, ensuring that proposals can be addressed in a timely manner while still maintaining a significant level of community involvement.

## Governance Votes

- **YES**: Approve the proposal to revise tokenomics and decrease the quorum required for votes to pass.
- **NO**: Disapprove of the proposal in its current form. Suggestions for improvements or adjustments should be indicated in the [Discord governance channel](https://discord.gg/wTkQKHP8yP).

## Conclusion

This proposal represents a strategic adjustment to the project's tokenomics and governance processes, aligning them with the evolving needs of our blockchain ecosystem and the broader market environment. It is a step towards ensuring our project's sustainability and scalability in the face of dynamic market conditions.
